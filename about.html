  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="./images/aboutpic.jpg" class = "pic">
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Puja Maheshwari, a girl born and raised in the Bay Area, California, who somehow
    ended up in the middle of Indiana. This Fall I will be a junior at Purdue University majoring
    in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics.<br> <br>

    Since I was young I have loved to dance, and have learned a variety of Indian dance types. The
    past couple years I’ve even been on a nationally competitive Indian dance team, Boiler Bhangra,
    at my school! <br> <br>

    I also enjoy traveling and taking pictures. I believe traveling and experiencing a variety of
    cultures and backgrounds is extremely important. I hope my photography can capture how I see
    different cultures and countries through my eyes and perspective.<br> <br>

    As a girl coder, I strongly believe in having an equal playing field in tech fields and hope to
    help work towards bridging the gender gap in STEM fields and spread more awareness of this issue.
    I aspire to one day start my own company and encourage other young girls to do the same.<br> <br>

    I hope my website can serve as a platform to share my dancing, pictures, travel adventures, technical
    projects, and my other hobbies include cooking, discovering new viewpoints, and sipping coffee!!<br> <br>

    If you would like to contact me for a technical or photography collaboration, please email me at
    <a href="mailto:flytheunknown@gmail.com">flytheunknown@gmail.com</a>. You can also reach me at any of my social media accounts linked below!
